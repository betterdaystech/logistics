                <p>&ldquo;I wanted to take a minute to thank you and your team. I have been very pleased since you stopped out and left your card. Your team’s responsiveness and follow through are something I feel has been second to none. I have grown comfortable leaning on LUCKY7 LOGISTICS team with some of my end of the day and “fun” requests. If the job didn’t seem possible or for any other reason it wasn’t going to work out, they spent just as much time and attention on the job as if they were able to help. The professionalism and customer care provide has been phenomenal.

When I sent the request earlier this week and received an out of office response from our Logistics Expert, I admit I muttered “crap” under my breath. He had left another Logistics Specialist as a contact. They jumped in and seamlessly provided the same service I am finding myself expecting. Which is something odd for me. I try not to have expectations and have had many disappointments from my freight forwarders. I understand things are out of your hands. Last night being an example with the flight delays. LUCKY7 LOGISTICS kept my customer privy to every detail and change in the updates. My customer truly appreciated the “white glove” feel of attention they provided. It is always a blessing when my customer gets news that could get them worked up and they are just tickled to death that someone is communicating with them.

Once again, I would like to thank your entire team for the hard work, they provide to help me save my customers day.&rdquo;</p>
